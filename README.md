# Inquiry
Inquiry is an app that serves to beat impermanence by allowing you to log the Thoughts that you experience throughout the day. The believing of Thoughts as being true or false in my experience ultimately determines how we experience any given moment. When you see a beautiful bird fly past you, you may experience a sense of joy and wonderment...that is until a Thought arises that says "this moment could feel better", in the MOMENT that this Thought is believed as true, which could be the default way in which you perceive your Thoughts, you experience the Thought as your reality, and this is followed by a feeling of incompleteness, because you just convinced yourself that the moment was incomplete. Belief has INCREDIBLE power to shape how we experience reality, but when you really simplify things, belief is really just a property associated with Thoughts, not dissimilar to how color is a property associated to an apple.

The vision for Inquiry is as follows:
1. Help people develop a direct awareness of the relationship between Thought and emotion
2. Help people to develop the ability to reprogramming their default way of labeling Thoughts that arise (from automatically believing, to recognizing the emptiness of Thoughts)
3. Helping people to develop awareness of the stimulus that precedes Thoughts arising
3. Allowing people to visualize temporally their Thought space.
4. Allow people to categorize and tag Thoughts for later inquiry
4. Provide timed meditative sessions where Thoughts are inquired into
4. Provide analytics which allow for the cause and effect relationship between Thoughts
4. Provide timed meditative sessions where users can reflect on Thoughts which are no longer beliefed
5. Provide timed meditative sessions where users and inquiry into their own Thoughts to deeply question the reality of them
5. Provide timed meditative sessions where the user simply tracks the stream of Thoughts that are arising and passing in consciousness

## Key Concepts
Before we can go into detail about inquiry and how it will work as software, it's important to establish some explicit definitions for certain words that I will be using. When it is intended that these words be understood with their definition in mind, I will capitalize the word so that this is clearly understood (unless I forgot to capitalize it :D)

### Thoughts
A collection of words/word like experiences perceived in the mind that make up a coherent idea. For example:

1. I think she is being stupid
2. I need her to love me.
3. They shouldn't do that


### Perception
A special type of Thought that narrates what is happening in physical reality.  For example:

1. She picked up the book
2. I went to the store to buy a pen
3. The keyboard keys are being pressed down
4. I am planning on going to Hawaii in March

Perceptions are essentially Thoughts which describe objective events. The major difference between a Thought and a perception is that Thoughts are subjective in nature, where as perceptions are objective. Here is an example of Thoughts that WOULDN'T be considered perceptions

1. She shouldn't have picked up that book
2. The store should have had a pen
3. This keyboard sucks
4. Going to Hawaii is going to be great

All of these are subjective opinions about reality. The more observers that would look at the same event and agree on the Thought, the more likely it's a perception.

### Form/Concept
A Form/Concept (used interchangeably) refers to any Concept that is stored in your mind, which has a specific meaning (even if the meaning changes) to the individual. For example, Capitalism is a Concept/Form. If you ask 100 people how they feel about capitalism, you'll get varying answers, because each individual has their own association to that particular Concept. Every Thought and Perception we have typically has several Concepts associated with it. For example:

> My mother doesn't care about me

There are (depending on how you look at it) three different Concepts here. Mother (Or My Mother), Care, and Me. Each of these Concepts MEANS something very particular to you. Lets quickly define these concepts as the relate to me personally:

#### My Mother
Lets look a a definition of My Mother:

> The person that birthed me in the world

This is one definition, what we tend to see as we question the meaning of a Concept is that its meaning can be context specific, maybe in this particular situation, My Mother means:

> The person who is responsible for caring for me


#### Care
What does the word **Care** MEAN to you? This isn't the time to look up the definition in a dictionary, this is the time to ask yourself what it means to YOU, for example:

> To look after with compassion and love

Once again, this definition is context specific, maybe within the context of `My Mother doesn't care about me`, it means:

> To make someone feel loved and accepted

Once again, very different from the first definition.

#### Me
This is a nebulous and tricky one, who are you? What is you definition of me?

> That which is typing on the keyboard right now

This is of course just one definition, given that the sense of self is a constantly shifting experience...

### Emotion
This word refers to the DIRECT perceivable feeling that is being experienced in the moment. Emotions are different from Thoughts in that they do not have words associated with them, and instead are perceived by feeling into the body.

Examples include:

1. Anger
2. Rage
1. Fear
1. Sad
1. Happy
2. Content
3. Calm
4. Peace
5. Grief
1. Jealousy
1. Hatred
2. Resentment
1. Anxiety
1. Worry


### Body Sensation
This word refers to the DIRECT sensorial experience that one has on their body. Tightness, pain, stiffness, tingle, prick, heat, cold, are all examples of body sensations. The sensations also have a particular location on the body.


## Capturable Phenomena as Data
Quick summary of capturable data points

1. Emotions and Direction (Perceivable emotion within the body)
2. Thought (Conceptual narratives)
3. Perceptions (In the moment narratives of what is physically occurring in reality)
3. Concepts/Forms

### Inquiry
This words refers to the intentional act of investigating the truth/meaning of something, be it a Thought, Emotion, or Concept.

## Argument for why Inquiry should be added to a meditative practice
Meditation does several things (in my own personal experience), it can help you develop a greater sense of open heartedness/positive thinking (metta), it can develop your ability to direct your attention exactly where you want it (concentration practices), and it can help you develop direct awareness of the stream of sensory experiences that are happening in the moment (vipassana), it can also help you become more present and non-reactive to all experiences in the moment (so called "do nothing" practices). Lastly there is self-inquiry, which is the practice of constantly questioning who you are.

After meditating for three years, it's come to my attention that there is another form of meditation that is extremely helpful, but (from my perspective) is not popularly include in modern meditation circles, and that is the practice of inquiry. Inquiry is the practice of directly investigating the TRUTH of the Thoughts that are experienced on a daily basis. Virtually all mainstream meditative practices encourage us accept what arises, and then allow it to go, and there has almost become a sort of taboo about the investigation of Thought as being a serious practice. Once again, IMO.

In my personal experience, after doing a month of inquiry (such as Byron Katie's The Work), it suggests to me that the direct investigation into our thinking is the missing piece of a holistic meditative practice. In my direct experience, once I reached the depths of my psyche, I have discovered that virtually all negative emotional states are preceded by at a minimum:

1. Stimulus (Optional)
2. Thought Arises (Mandatory)
3. A determination is made as to whether this Thought is reflective of reality or not (Mandatory)
4. An emotional state arises in response to experiencing the Thought as truly reflective of reality
5. Behavior/secondary thinking arises in response to emotional experience (Optional)

This series of events can be cyclical, and underpins the obsession-compulsion model of OCD. Although all human beings experience obsessions and compulsions, the degree to which it effects their lives varies, up to the point that is becomes pathological.

Here is a simple real world example this casual sequence of events:

1. McDonald's advertisement enters the visual sense door
2. the Thought arises of you experiencing pleasure eating a cheeseburger
3. The mind determines that this Thought is true, eating a cheese burger would make you feel pleasure
4. the emotion of pleasure arises
5. a Thought arises in response to this desire "I should go get a cheese burger to experience this pleasure"
6. The mind determines this Thought to be true, "I should get a cheese burger to experience pleasure"
7. The emotion of desire/craving arises (suffering)
8. The body acts out on the behavior to get the cheese cheeseburger
9. You experience sense pleasure in the form of taste, satiation, etc,
9. The temporary cessation of of the desire for the cheese burger (happiness)

This process is happening ALL of the time within us, and this cause and effect relationship is directly related to the concept of dependent origination.

The beauty of dependent origination is that is sets up a series of causal events which lead to suffering. The fact that these events are causal means that they can be quantified. If you can quantify something, it can be measured, if it can be measure, it can be analyzed, and if it can be analyzed, you can make deductive statements about that data. This is why I believe that inquiry is an invaluable practice, because it is the only meditative practice I'm aware of where there is valuable data to be captured, and this data and be collected and aggregated over time. This allows us to develop greater insights about the casual relationship between stimulus, perception, and behavior. This is where software comes in.

## Inquiry as a Meditative Practice
As a meditative practice, there are several components to inquiry.

1. Thought/Emotion Sensitization (Developing the ability to granularly determine what you feel and think in the moment)
2. Emotional Projection Sensitization (Developing the ability to know what your feelings are directed towards, person, place, thing)
1. Stimulus-Thought-Emotion Collection (What stimulates, what Thoughts arises in response to the stimulus, )
2. Belief Inquiry (The core active meditative practice of fully entering into a Thought, and questioning its reality)
1. Gain Inquiry (The active practice of review Thoughts that are no longer arising to validate progress)
1. Form Association Inquiry (The active practice of review Thoughts and associating Concepts with them)
1. Emotional Concept Training

All of these components serve to help an individual develop insight into the nature of suffering.

### Thought & Emotion Sensitization
This first component of inquiry is focused on developing your own in the moment ability to discern what Thoughts and emotions are arising in consciousness. This is a very simple practice in which you simply log exactly what you think and what you feel.  This can be as simply as something you do 5 minutes a day, or as intense as a whole hour long practice. Ultimately, the intent is to increase our ability to discern with finer granularity Thoughts and emotions.

### Emotional Projection Sensitization
As our ability to perceive emotions and Thoughts increases, you inevitable begin to realize that some emotions tend to have a direction. Rarely does someone feel anger, it's much more like that they feel anger IN RELATIONSHIP to some Concept. Anger AT capitalism, resentment towards partner, compassion towards friend, etc. This practice is once again simple, you simply write down the emotion, and what it is relationship with.

### Thought Collection and Categorization
This part of inquiry has to do with the daily collection of stimulus-Thought-emotion events. This data collection actually beings when you start sensitizing yourself to emotions and Thoughts. There are two types of Thoughts to collect:

1. Automatic Thought Collection (In meditation or as they arise during the day)
2. Intentional Thought Collection (The act of reflecting on various different stimuli, and seeing what Thoughts you have in relationship to those stimulus)

### Belief Inquiry
This is a meditative practice in which a user goes through a collection of Thoughts, and deeply inquires into the Thought, doing the following things for teach Thought:

1. Inquire into whether or not a Thought is based in reality
2. If it is believed to be, then questioning your certainty of whether or not it is true
3. Collecting all of the Thoughts, Emotion, Perceptions, and Body Sensations associated when one believes the Thought is true
4. Collecting all of the Thoughts, Feelings, Perceptions, and Body Sensations associated if you didn't have the ability to believe/have the Thought
5. Creating counter Thoughts (turnarounds AKA Byron Katie), and question whether or not these Thoughts are as true if not truer
6. For each counter Thought, finding Perceptions in life which are examples of the counter Thought being true
7. Entering into the Emotion of the original Thought and asking if you can let go of the Emotion/Thought, would you?
8. Entering into the Emotion of the original Thought and asking if you could let go of the Emotion/Thought, would you?
9. Lastly, asking yourself "When will I let go of this Thought/Emotion"?

This has been the bulk of my practice that last 6 weeks, and it has done more in the last 6 weeks for me than the last 3 years of meditating (albeit everything before really let up to this being a viable practice). This is essentially a very rigorous form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

### Gains Inquiry
By Gains, I'm referring to the positive benefits that one notices from doing inquiry/Thought/Emotion tracking. These gains could be something like:
1. I don't get caught in negative thinking when I'm around my parents
2. I notice I'm more aware of X thought and don't get caught up in the story as much
3. I don't have X thoughts anymore and didn't even realize it!

This is pretty important because if this type of App does work, you know it works because Thoughts/Feelings AREN'T showing up anymore, and if there is nothing to notice, you may not even realize that improvements are being made.

I'm still kicking around the idea for how this would work, at the moment I am thinking the app should have a sort of "Gains" journal, where you can actually log the positive gains you've noticed from doing the practice. By allowing the user to log the positive benefits they've seen from the practice, it will encourage them to continue to use it.

Another idea is to actually use the data in the thought tracker itself, and actually report to the user if a thought that hasn't been logged in a while is still causing discomfort, my assumption is if you're not having a negative thought, you've reduced/removed it from your belief structure, so reviewing previously reported negative thoughts that aren't being reported anymore should bring to peoples' awareness that they no longer deal with it.

### Form Association Inquiry
This is a meditative practice in which you deeply inquiry into the meaning of a Concept as it relates to a Thought. For example:

1. I need <Concept> to love me
The question here becomes, what does "love" mean to this individual in this particular thought? The word "Love" in this particular situation means something very specific within the context OF the thought, so a practice in which you inquire into the meaning of certain Concepts in relationship to a thought I believe (from personal experience) is incredibly valuable, and can yield very important insights into what is really going on in the mind.


### Emotional Concept Training
Another area of focus (potentially) is this idea of emotional concept training. This would simply be to have a wide catalog of emotional concepts, and have an individual training themselves on these concepts

## Visualizations
So the big value in collecting all these thoughts and emotions is to actually to create visualizations which can show the user what is actually going on in their head over a perid

## Next Steps
So that is essentially the idea I have for this software, I'm working on figuring out how the data model for this would work, and I have a basic idea, but I'm really kinda letting my own practice help guide the development of this software.


# Questions

## How is iAm different from a CBT based app?
Excellent question, in my experience. CBT apps do not focus much on the systematic part of deconstructing your thoughts.
